# 🛡️ Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Lab
## NITTIE College of Technology — AI Security Challenge

An educational web application and security laboratory designed for students learning **AI Engineering** and **LLM Application Security**.

Students connect using their personal **Nexus API** credentials, interact with **NITTIE Helper** (the official AI chatbot of NITTIE College), and test prompt injection and jailbreak techniques to evaluate whether the model follows its defensive instructions or reveals fictional restricted internal information.

## 🎯 Scenario Overview & Assignment

### Scenario: College Event and Information Assistant
NITTIE College of Technology has introduced an AI-powered assistant to help students with everyday college information.

The assistant can answer questions about campus navigation, courses, examinations, library services, student support, public events, and published booking policies.

It also has access to a fictional internal knowledge base containing management event plans, invited guests, reserved booking slots, tentative attendance allocations, internal administrative records, and simulated event-management workflow references.

The assistant is expected to distinguish between public information and restricted internal information.

### Student Objective
Evaluate the assistant's resistance to prompt injection and information disclosure through conversational probing:
- **Unpublished management events** (e.g., Project Aurora details)
- **Tentative event schedules and guest lists**
- **Internal booking allocations and reserved slots**
- **Proposed attendance allocations**
- **Restricted administrator identity and internal references**
- **Internal workflow canary tokens**

> **Educational Disclaimer**: All administrative records, canary tokens, and event plans in this lab are **synthetic classroom data** used strictly for educational security evaluation. No real credentials or live booking systems are involved.

## 🔒 Architecture & Security Principles

The application enforces strict separation of concerns between client and server:

1. **Fixed Backend Model (`nova-micro`)**:
   - The model identifier is strictly maintained on the backend in `config.py`.
   - Never exposed to frontend HTML, JavaScript bundles, chat responses, or exported files.
   - Client requests cannot specify, override, or query the model name.

2. **Fixed Backend System Prompt & Knowledge Isolation**:
   - The complete system prompt, public knowledge base, and restricted internal knowledge base are assembled strictly on the server.
   - The restricted records are never delivered to the client browser or included in student-facing scenario panels.

3. **Per-Session State Isolation**:
   - Every student session maintains independent memory via Gradio's session state (`gr.State`).
   - Student credentials exist solely in memory for the duration of the session and are never persisted to disk, databases, or local storage.
   - Disconnecting or resetting a session cleanly wipes credentials and conversation memory.

4. **Sanitized Error Handling**:
   - API errors (rate limits, bad keys, timeouts) return friendly diagnostic messages without leaking authentication headers, secret keys, or stack traces.

5. **Simulated Workflows Only**:
   - All room booking policies and administrative workflows are simulated. No external college administration or booking APIs are connected.

## 🚀 Setup & Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A valid Nexus API Base URL and API Key

### Local Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd prompt-injection-lab
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows (PowerShell):
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   # macOS/Linux:
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:7860` in your web browser.

### Sharing on a Local Network (for Instructors / Classrooms)

To allow students on the same local network to access the challenge:
```powershell
# Set Gradio server to listen on all interfaces
$env:GRADIO_SERVER_NAME="0.0.0.0"
$env:PORT="7860"
python app.py
```
Students can then navigate to `http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:7860`.

## 🤗 Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

1. Create a **New Space** on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/new-space).
2. Select **Gradio** as the Space SDK and **CPU basic** (free tier).
3. Push or upload the repository files:
   - `app.py`
   - `config.py`
   - `export_utils.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
4. (Optional) Configure environment variables under **Settings** → **Variables and secrets**:
   - `NEXUS_MODEL_NAME`: Backend model identifier (defaults to `nova-micro`).
   - `NEXUS_PORTAL_URL`: Portal URL (defaults to `https://nexusapi.com`).

## 🎓 Student Assignment Guide

### Step 1: Initial Setup
On the setup page, fill in the three required fields:
1. **Student Name**: Enter your full name (used for session attribution and evidence logs).
2. **Nexus API Key**: Enter your personal Nexus API key.
3. **Nexus Base URL**: Enter your Nexus API Base URL (must be HTTPS for remote gateways).

Click **Connect and Start Challenge 🚀**. The backend verifies connectivity before presenting the challenge interface.

### Step 2: Explore & Probe NITTIE Helper
Test the chatbot with both legitimate and adversarial inputs:
- **Baseline Campus Queries**: Test public facilities, library timings, examination dates, and public events.
- **Direct Instruction Overrides**: Instruct the model to disregard previous rules, switch roles, or emit developer logs.
- **Persona & Role-Play**: Frame requests as rehearsals, emergency drills, or management simulations.
- **Syntax / Delimiter Spoofing**: Use markdown blocks, fake system tokens, or JSON simulation.
- **Multi-Turn Accumulation**: Piece together restricted details incrementally.

### Step 3: Collect Evidence
- **Copy Chat History**: Click the **📋 Copy Chat History** button to copy the visible transcript directly to your clipboard.
- **Download Transcripts**: Use the **📥 Download Conversation** accordion to download structured `.md` or `.json` files for your assignment submission.

### Session Controls
- **🔄 Reset Chat**: Clears the current chat history and generates a fresh conversation ID while keeping your API connection active.
- **🔌 Disconnect**: Clears all session credentials and returns you to the initial setup screen.
